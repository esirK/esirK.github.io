- Worked in the content development team where I was responsible for adding new integrations to the core product ranging from azure cloud products, google cloud product, aws products e.g S3, AWS Lambda functions, RDS e.t.c This was to allow users to create such services directly from cloudbolt withouth having to go to the different cloud providers. We achieved this by utilising the APIs provided by these cloud providers.
- Worked on monitoring tools integrations e.g Datadog, SolarWinds and NewRelic. This was to allow our customers to monitor their servers directly from cloudbolt.
- Worked on adding backup integrations to cloudbolt. Some of them include Veeam and vSphere. This was to allow users to backup their servers and also perform backup restorations directly from cloudbolt platform.
- Wrote integration tests for every integration that we added. From this we could be able to immediately detect when an integration broke e.g due to api changes.
